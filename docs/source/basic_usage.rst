First steps
###########

Carma relies on Pybind11 for the generation of the bindings and casting of the arguments from Python to C++.
Make sure you are familiar with `Pybind11 <https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html>`_ before continuing on.

You can embed CARMA in a Pybind11 project using CMake command

.. code-block:: cmake

    ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(extern/carma)
    TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(<your_target> PRIVATE carma)

See `Pybind11's CMake build system documentation <https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/compiling.html#building-with-cmake>`_ or `CARMA's examples <https://github.com/RUrlus/carma/blob/stable/examples/CMakeLists.txt>`_ for a start.

.. note:: 
    
    At the time of writing CARMA requires a forked version of Armadillo that
    uses Numpy's allocator and deallocator.
    The forked version is shipped with library and provided at build time, see :ref:`Build Configuration` for details.

The tests and examples can be compiled using CMake.
CMake can be installed with :bash:`pip install cmake`, your package manager or directly from `cmake <http://cmake.org/download/>`__.

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=. -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=true  -DBUILD_TESTS=true .. && make install

To run the tests you need to install `pytest`:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install pytest

and run:

.. code-block:: bash

   ctest

To install `carma`, you have to define 

.. code-block:: bash
    
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/installation/path/directory

(default value is ``/usr/local``)

Installation directory contains

.. code-block::

    include                  # carma headers
    extern/armadillo-code    # fork of armadillo required by carma
    tests                    # carma tests with python module (if enabled using -DBUILD_TESTS=on)
    examples                 # carma python examples with python module (if enabled using -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=on)

Design Patterns
###############

CARMA was designed with three patterns in mind: borrow, transfer ownership and view.

Borrow
------

You can borrow the underlying memory of a Numpy array using the ``arr_to_*(py::array_t<T>, copy=false)``. The Armadillo object should not be returned without a copy out. Use this when you want to modify the memory in-place. If the array is not well behaved, see :ref:`Well behaved`, the data is copied to well-behaved memory and swapped in place of the input array. If ``copy=true`` is equivalent to the copy approach below.

.. note:: the size of the Armadillo object is not allowed change when you borrow.

Transfer ownership
------------------

You can transfer ownership to Armadillo using steal or copy.

Steal
*****

If you want to take ownership of the underlying memory but don't want to copy the
data you can steal the array. The Armadillo object can be safely returned out without a copy. There are multiple compile time definitions on how the memory is stolen, see :doc:`Configuration <configuration>` for details. If the memory of the
array is not well-behaved a copy of the memory is stolen.

After stealing the Armadillo behaves as if has allocated the memory itself, hence it will also clean the memory upon destruction.

.. note:: the size of the Armadillo object is allowed change after stealing.

Copy
****

If you want to give Armadillo full control of underlying memory but also want to keep Numpy as owner you should copy. The Armadillo object can be safely returned out without a copy. If the memory of the array is not well-behaved a copy of the memory is used instead.

.. note:: the size of the Armadillo object is allowed change after copying.

View
----

If you want to have a read-only view on the underlying memory you can use ``arr_to_*_view``. If the underlying memory is not well-behaved it will be copied.
